//(a) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate an ArrayList of String.
		
		List<String> stringArray = new ArrayList<String>();
		//be sure to import the files that allow both the list and the array list to work.
		
//(b) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashSet of StringBuilder.
		Set<StringBuilder> stringBuildSet = new HashSet<StringBuilder>();
		//again, import the files. And punctuation is important.
		
//(c) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashMap of String, String.
		Map<String, String> dictionary = new HashMap<String, String>();
